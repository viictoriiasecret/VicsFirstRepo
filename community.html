        <li> Gaming community: <span style = "color:rgb(237, 22, 22)" >  Making games as hyperrealistic as possible is cool and all, but companies are loosing their distinct art styles. </span></li>  
        <li> Fashion Community: <span style = "color:rgb(237, 22, 22)" >         There's no such thing as bad fits or bad styles, fashion is subjective and the best thing anyone can do is dress for themselves, the worst thing anyone can do is dress for others.
